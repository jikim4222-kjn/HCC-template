A structural framework for comparison across multiple observational levels,
based on saturation, projection towers, gauge 2-cells, and defect
propagation.

## Overview

Hyper Comparison Categories (HCC) provide a general categorical
architecture for organizing comparison problems that involve:

- **Saturation** (idempotent monads fixing interpretation)
- **Projection towers** (hierarchies of observational levels)
- **Gauge 2-cells** (noncommutativity between saturation and observation)
- **Defects and support** (quantitative comparison invariants)
- **External input (EI)** (problem-dependent local bounds)
- **Propagation** (automatic extension of EI across the tower)

The framework isolates universal structural mechanisms from
problem-specific estimates, yielding a reusable protocol for global
comparison arguments.
